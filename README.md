# DimensionShift
DimensionShift was created at MHacks V

The goal of our project, "DimensionShift", is to create a maze game for Oculus Rift. Using computer arrow key input and the head tracking capabilities of the Oculus Rift, the player will attempt to navigate through a maze that will be filled with RIDICULOUS traps, pitfalls, easter eggs... and hopefully fire. Lots and lots of fire.
*(Please Beth? Pleeaseeee?)*

But yeah, eventually we may attempt to make this compatible with Google Cardboard as well! Keep your eyes peeled!
